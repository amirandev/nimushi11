Here's a structured homework assignment that will require students to practice using Git branches, logging history, reverting changes, resetting commits, checking out different states, and merging branches.

## **Homework: Git Branching and History Management**  
### **Objective**  
The goal of this assignment is to help students gain hands-on experience with Git commands related to branches, commit history, and undoing changes.  

### **Prerequisites**  
- Git installed on the system  
- GitHub (or another Git remote repository) account  
- Basic understanding of Git concepts  

---

### **Instructions**  

1. **Initialize a New Git Repository**  
   - Create a new folder for your project:  
     ```sh
     mkdir git-homework && cd git-homework
     ```  
   - Initialize a Git repository inside the folder:  
     ```sh
     git init
     ```  

2. **Create and Modify Files**  
   - Create a file named `main.txt` and add the following content:  
     ```sh
     echo "This is the main branch file" > main.txt
     ```  
   - Stage and commit the file:  
     ```sh
     git add main.txt  
     git commit -m "Initial commit: added main.txt"
     ```  

3. **Create and Switch to a New Branch**  
   - Create a new branch named `feature-branch`:  
     ```sh
     git branch feature-branch
     ```  
   - Switch to the new branch:  
     ```sh
     git checkout feature-branch
     ```  
   - Modify `main.txt` to:  
     ```sh
     echo "This is the modified content in feature-branch" > main.txt
     ```  
   - Commit the changes:  
     ```sh
     git add main.txt  
     git commit -m "Modified main.txt in feature-branch"
     ```  

4. **View Commit History**  
   - Use the log command to see the commit history:  
     ```sh
     git log --oneline --graph --all
     ```  

5. **Resetting and Reverting**  
   - Create a new commit:  
     ```sh
     echo "This is an experimental line" >> main.txt
     git add main.txt  
     git commit -m "Added an experimental line"
     ```  
   - Use `git reset` to undo the last commit but keep the changes:  
     ```sh
     git reset --soft HEAD~1
     ```  
   - Check the commit history again:  
     ```sh
     git log --oneline
     ```  
   - If needed, use `git revert` to undo a specific commit while keeping history:  
     ```sh
     git revert <commit_hash>
     ```  

6. **Merge Feature Branch into Main**  
   - Switch back to `main` branch:  
     ```sh
     git checkout main
     ```  
   - Merge `feature-branch` into `main`:  
     ```sh
     git merge feature-branch
     ```  

7. **Push Changes to a Remote Repository**  
   - Create a repository on GitHub (or any remote Git service).  
   - Add the remote repository:  
     ```sh
     git remote add origin <repository_url>
     ```  
   - Push the changes:  
     ```sh
     git push -u origin main
     ```

### **Submission**  
- Take screenshots of your terminal showing the execution of commands.  
- Provide the GitHub repository link.  
- Answer the following questions in a text file:  
  1. What is the difference between `git reset` and `git revert`?  
  2. How does `git merge` work? What happens when there is a conflict?  
  3. How can you switch between branches using Git?

This assignment ensures students gain practical knowledge of Git while also reinforcing theoretical concepts. Let me know if you want any modifications! ðŸš€
